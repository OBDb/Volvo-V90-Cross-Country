    description: "The Volvo V90 Cross Country is the rugged, adventure-oriented variant of the V90 luxury wagon, continuing Volvo's Cross Country tradition that began with the V70 XC in 1997. Launched in 2017 as part of Volvo's revitalized 90-series lineup, it's built on the Scalable Product Architecture (SPA) platform shared with the standard V90, S90, and XC90. The Cross Country features increased ground clearance (approximately 65mm higher than the standard V90), standard all-wheel drive, and protective body cladding around the wheel arches, side sills, and bumpers. The exterior design shares the elegant, clean lines of the V90 but with a more robust, adventure-ready appearance. The interior is nearly identical to the standard V90, showcasing Scandinavian luxury with premium materials including wood, leather, and metal accents, centered around a 9-inch portrait-oriented touchscreen that controls most vehicle functions. Powertrain options included various Drive-E four-cylinder engines, primarily the T5 turbocharged and T6 turbo- and supercharged variants. Advanced safety and driver assistance systems are comprehensive, including Pilot Assist semi-autonomous driving capability, City Safety collision avoidance, and numerous other features that continue Volvo's safety leadership. The V90 Cross Country successfully combines luxury, versatility, and all-road capability, appealing to outdoor enthusiasts who prefer wagons to traditional SUVs."

    description: "The facelifted Volvo V90 Cross Country debuted in February 2020 with updated styling and technology. The exterior changes include taillights with sequential LED indicators, while Inscription variants received a chrome garnish on the front bumper. Inside, the 9-inch portrait-oriented touchscreen continued to control most functions with updated software and connectivity features. The powertrain lineup evolved significantly: 2022 introduced mild hybrid technology replacing the belt-driven supercharger with an electric one and adding a Belt Alternator Starter (BAS) unit for improved fuel economy. By 2023, Volvo removed conventional engines as options entirely, making mild hybrids the standard. The T8 plug-in hybrid continued throughout this period. Advanced safety systems remained comprehensive, including Pilot Assist semi-autonomous driving capability and City Safety collision avoidance. The V90 Cross Country continued to offer elevated ground clearance, standard AWD, and rugged body cladding for adventure-ready capability while maintaining its luxury wagon character."
